# Optimal Gasoline Price Predictions Using ANFIS Model

This project implements an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model to predict optimal gasoline prices based on historical data and relevant features.

## Overview

Gasoline prices fluctuate due to various economic and geopolitical factors. Accurate price prediction models help stakeholders make better decisions. This project applies an ANFIS model combining neural networks and fuzzy logic to forecast gasoline prices with improved accuracy.

The approach is inspired by and adapted from the methodology in the paper:
**"Optimal Gasoline Price Predictions: Leveraging the
ANFIS Regression Model"**
[DOI: 10.1155/2024/8462056](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1155/2024/8462056)

The work is implemented as a Kaggle notebook available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gamzeakkurt/optimal-gasoline-price-predictions-anfis-model).


## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is sourced from the **U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)** and contains weekly U.S. retail gasoline prices (in dollars per gallon) across all grades and formulations.

### üóìÔ∏è Time Span

* **Start Date:** April 5, 1993
* **End Date:** July 31, 2023
* **Total Samples:** 1,583 weekly observations

### üìà Data Characteristics

* **Frequency:** Weekly (one observation per week)
* **Unit:** U.S. Dollars per Gallon
* **Type:** Univariate time series (only price data considered)
* **Coverage:** Nationwide U.S. average prices encompassing all gasoline grades and formulations

This dataset captures both long-term historical trends and short-term fluctuations in gasoline prices, making it well-suited for time series modeling and predictive analytics.

### üìé Note

The dataset is publicly available from the U.S. EIA website and can be accessed here:
